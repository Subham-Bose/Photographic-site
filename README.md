# Photographic-site
### This is the first miniproject made by me while in Newton School.
Made this project by only using HTML and CSS.
This is only a single page website and have three sections.
* Home section- It is the introductory section which have the name of website and a link to contact us section,
* Album section - It is a scrollable section of different photos, having name and description about the photos. The photos gets scalled a little bit while hovering over it.
* Contact-Us section - It is a simple contact us section containing email and phone number.


## TODO list
* To add more CSS animation.
* Make the scrollable more user friendly.
* To create a animated contact us section.
* To create a animated home page.
